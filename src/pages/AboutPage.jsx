        <p>
          Hello there! Thank you for visiting my personal website.{" "}
          <span className="font-mono text-sky-400">
            I'm Putra Rizky Nugraha,
          </span>{" "}
          a dedicated student at the Faculty of Science and Technology,
          Universitas Terbuka, majoring in Information Systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I am navigating an exciting career transition to become a
          professional Software Engineer, with a sharp focus on{" "}
          <span className="font-mono text-sky-400">Web Development</span> My
          journey into tech is driven by a genuine passion for building digital
          solutions that are not only functional but also scalable and
          user-centric. I am deeply committed to mastering the craft of coding,
          moving beyond just writing syntax to engineering robust software
          architectures.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a Fullstack Developer, I have honed my skills across a modern
          technology stack. On the backend, I leverage the power of{" "}
          <span className="font-mono text-sky-400">PHP(Laravel)</span> and{" "}
          <span className="font-mono text-sky-400">Golang</span> to build secure
          and efficient APIs, managing data structures with{" "}
          <span className="font-mono text-sky-400">MySQL</span>. On the
          frontend, I utilize{" "}
          <span className="font-mono text-sky-400">React</span> and{" "}
          <span className="font-mono text-sky-400">Tailwind CSS</span> to create
          responsive and intuitive user interfaces. My development workflow is
          disciplined and professional, incorporating{" "}
          <span className="font-mono text-sky-400">Docker</span> for consistent
          containerized environments and{" "}
          <span className="font-mono text-sky-400">Postman</span> for
          comprehensive API testing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a staunch believer in{" "}
          <span className="font-mono text-sky-400">Clean Code</span> principles.
          For me, writing code is a form of communication; it must be clear,
          maintainable, and efficient to ensure long-term success. Whether I'm
          architecting a new feature or optimizing an existing system, I strive
          for excellence and clarity in every layer of the application.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond my personal projects, I am an active member of the{" "}
          <span className="font-mono text-sky-400">
            Google Developers Group (GDG) community.
          </span>{" "}
          Engaging with this vibrant network allows me to stay ahead of the
          latest industry trends, share knowledge, and collaborate with
          like-minded innovators. I am a fast learner who thrives in dynamic
          environments, and I am eager to bring my technical skills and fresh
          perspective to contribute to impactful projects.
